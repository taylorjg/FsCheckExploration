Add the following NuGet packages:

* [FsCheck](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FsCheck/)
* [FsCheck.NUnit](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FsCheck.Nunit/)

If using VS2012, the following *pre-release* NuGet package is also needed
in order to obtain FSharp.Core.dll v 4.3.1.0
(FsCheck is built against F# 3.1 which only seems to be supported on VS2013)

* [FSharp.Core.Microsoft.Signed](http://www.nuget.org/packages/FSharp.Core.Microsoft.Signed/0.0.1-beta1)
